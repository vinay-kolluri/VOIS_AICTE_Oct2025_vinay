## 🧩 Project Overview

The notebook analyzes Airbnb data from an Excel dataset (`Airbnb_Open_Data_Set.xlsx`). It includes:

* Loading and preprocessing data using **Pandas** and **NumPy**
* Cleaning missing values and converting data types
* Visualizing property types, neighborhood distributions, and price trends
* Using **Seaborn** and **Plotly Express** for interactive visual insights
